# Organizations

Organizations in Sourcetool provide a way to group users, manage access control, and share resources across teams. They are the foundation for collaboration in Sourcetool applications.

## What are Organizations?

An organization in Sourcetool is a container for:

- Users with different roles and permissions
- Groups for fine-grained access control
- Environments for different deployment stages
- Pages that make up your applications

Organizations enable teams to:

1. Collaborate on building internal tools
2. Control who can access what resources
3. Manage permissions at scale
4. Share common resources across projects

## User Roles

Organizations support different user roles with varying levels of permissions:

### Admin

Admins have full control over the organization:

- Manage users and their roles
- Create and manage environments
- Create and manage groups
- Access all pages and resources
- Manage API keys
- Configure organization settings

### Developer

Developers can build and manage applications:

- Create and edit pages
- Access development environments
- Create and manage groups
- View users in the organization
- Limited access to production environments (based on configuration)

### Member

Members have basic access to use applications:

- View and interact with pages they have access to
- Cannot create or edit pages
- Cannot manage users or groups
- Cannot access sensitive environments

## Next Steps

Now that you understand organizations, learn about:

- [Pages](./pages) for building your application's UI
- [Environments](./environments) for deploying your application
- [Groups](../reference/groups) for managing access control
