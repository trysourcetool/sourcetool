# Sourcetool

**Build Internal Tools with Just Backend Code**

Sourcetool is an open-source internal tool builder that enables you to create full-featured applications without writing any frontend code.

## üåü About Sourcetool

We develop Sourcetool, an open-source internal tool builder that handles frontend complexities automatically, allowing developers to focus on implementing business logic in backend code only.

### Backend-First Development
Focus on your business logic while we handle the UI. Build complete internal tools using only Go code. No frontend expertise required.

### Type-Safe & Flexible
Built with Go's type system for reliability. Create robust applications with type-safe APIs and seamless integration.

## ‚ú® Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| üíª Backend-only, Code-first development | Build full-featured internal tools using only backend code with type-safe APIs, Git version control, and seamless integration with development workflows |
| üé® Rich UI components | Pre-built components (forms, tables, inputs, etc.) |
| üîê Granular permissions | Manage access to your internal tools with flexible group-based permissions |
| üåê Multiple environment support | Easily switch between different environments (development, staging, production) |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Sourcetool uses a three-tier architecture to connect your backend code directly to web browsers:

1. **Your Backend**
   - Contains your business logic and UI definitions
   - Written in Go using Sourcetool SDK

2. **Sourcetool Server**
   - Handles authentication and authorization
   - Manages WebSocket connections
   - Secures communication between components

3. **Web Browser**
   - Automatically generates the UI
   - Provides real-time interaction
   - No frontend code required

All components communicate bidirectionally in real-time through secure WebSocket connections.

### How It Works:
1. You define UI components in your backend code
2. Sourcetool Server handles auth & permissions
3. UI is automatically rendered in browser
4. User interactions return to your backend code

## üéØ Components

Sourcetool provides UI components you can use directly from Go code:

| Component Type | Available Components |
|---------------|---------------------|
| üìù Input Components | TextInput, TextArea, NumberInput, DateInput, DateTimeInput, TimeInput |
| üìã Selection Components | Selectbox, MultiSelect, Radio, Checkbox, CheckboxGroup |
| üî≥ Layout Components | Columns, Form |
| üìä Display Components | Markdown, Table |
| üîò Interactive Components | Button |

## üöÄ Get Started

> **Note:** While our cloud version is coming soon, you can start using Sourcetool today by deploying it in your own environment.

1. **Deploy Sourcetool**
   - Follow our [Deployment Guide](https://docs.trysourcetool.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) to set up Sourcetool in your environment
   - Use Docker for quick and easy deployment

2. **Install the Sourcetool SDK**
   ```bash
   go get github.com/trysourcetool/sourcetool-go
   ```

3. **Write your first internal tool**
   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "github.com/trysourcetool/sourcetool-go"
       "github.com/trysourcetool/sourcetool-go/textinput"
       "github.com/trysourcetool/sourcetool-go/table"
   )

   func listUsersPage(ui sourcetool.UIBuilder) error {
       ui.Markdown("## Users")

       // Search form
       name := ui.TextInput("Name", textinput.WithPlaceholder("Enter name to search"))
       
       // Fetch users from the database
       users, err := listUsers(name)
       if err != nil {
           return err
       }

       // Display users in a table
       ui.Table(users, table.WithHeader("Users List"))
       
       return nil
   }

   func main() {
       s := sourcetool.New(&sourcetool.Config{
           APIKey:   "your_api_key",
           Endpoint: "wss://your-sourcetool-instance"  // Your self-hosted Sourcetool endpoint
       })
       
       // Register pages
       s.Page("/users", "Users List", listUsersPage)
       
       if err := s.Listen(); err != nil {
           log.Fatal(err)
       }
   }
   ```
